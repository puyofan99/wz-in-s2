A disassembly of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, modified to include THE Wood Zone.

By default, it replaces the first zone you play when you press start on the Title Screen (by code, not literally), but you can restore it back to Emerald Hill Zone.

The only thing that is bugged is basically the title card. That is all. A rather accurate port, with a fixed slope collision, and the background no longer being on the lower end of the foreground. Wow.

To build this, use build.bat if you're a Windows user, or build.lua otherwise. The built ROM will be called 's2built.bin'.
