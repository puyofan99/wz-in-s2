*To build this, use build.bat if you're a Windows user, or build.lua otherwise. The built ROM will be called 's2built.bin'.*

WOOD ZONE STUFF:

*By default, it replaces the first zone you play when you press start on the Title Screen (by code, not literally), but you can restore it back to Emerald Hill Zone.*

*The only thing that is bugged is basically the title card. That is all. A rather accurate port, with a fixed slope collision, and the background no longer being on the lower end of the foreground.* ***Wow.***
